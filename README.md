# Searchable — AI Search Visibility

**Searchable** is an **AI citation tracking and visibility platform** that shows when and how often AI assistants (e.g. ChatGPT, Claude) cite your brand’s URLs in answers. It turns “are we in AI answers?” into a measurable, comparable metric you can improve.

## The problem

People ask AI tools for recommendations and decisions. If your site isn’t cited, you’re invisible in those answers. Until now there was no clear way to measure or benchmark that visibility.

## What Searchable does

- **Measures AI visibility** — The **Searchable Visibility Score™** (0–100) reflects how often your domain is cited by AI models for relevant queries. You get a single number, trend (e.g. +/− %), and a 30-day history so you can track progress.
- **Surfaces trends** — Compare your visibility over 7d, 30d, or 90d and see how you stack up vs. top competitors on the same queries.
- **Competitive benchmarking** — See who else gets cited for the same queries (overlap competitors), their share of voice, and a leaderboard. Use overlap heatmaps and query-level comparison to see where you win or lose.
- **Content attribution** — See which URLs drive citations: citation count, unique queries, average position in the answer, and “opportunity” pages (cited but ranked low). Identify top performers and pages to optimize or fix (e.g. redirects, 404s).
- **Ingest & normalize** — Ingest raw AI responses via API; the platform extracts and normalizes citations (inline links, numbered refs, plain URLs) and stores query, model, and domain so everything ties back to your score and reports.

## Who it’s for

- **Product and brand marketers** who care about being recommended by AI.
- **SEO and content teams** who want to optimize for AI citations, not only traditional search.
- **Competitive / insights teams** who need to compare their brand’s AI visibility to competitors.

## Positioning

Searchable is **“AI search visibility”** — the place to measure, benchmark, and improve how often AI models cite your brand. It’s built as a serious, data-first SaaS: dark UI, clear metrics, and every insight paired with an action (e.g. “Optimize this page”, “View queries”, “Refresh”). Calm, confident, and built for teams that treat AI answers as a channel worth measuring and optimizing.
